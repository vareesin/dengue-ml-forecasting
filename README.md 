# Dengue Forecasting Model

This repository contains the implementation of various time series forecasting models for predicting dengue fever cases in Thailand's Health District 12. The project implements and compares multiple forecasting approaches as described in our research paper.

## Project Overview

Thailand's Health District 12 (comprising Songkhla, Satun, Trang, Phatthalung, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat provinces) has experienced significant dengue fever outbreaks. This project aims to develop accurate forecasting models to predict dengue fever cases using historical data from 2015-2023.

### Research Findings

The research evaluated multiple forecasting approaches, with key findings:

- Best Performing Model: Neural Network Autoregressive (NNAR) model
  - Configuration: NNAR(2,1,2)
  - MSE: 439,337.643
  - RMSE: 662.825
  - MAPE: 68.205%

- Best Trend Equation:
  ```
  yt = 0.2797tÂ² + 2664.5478 + Ss
  ```
  where Ss represents seasonal indices

## Models Implemented

1. **NNAR (Neural Network Autoregressive)**
   - Implementation: `ann_model.py`
   - Architecture: NNAR(2,1,2)
   - Features: Seasonal and non-seasonal lags
   - Best performing model overall

2. **ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)**
   - Implementation: `arima_model.py`
   - Configuration: ARIMA(1,1,0)
   - Includes stationarity testing
   - Competitive performance for short-term forecasts

3. **Random Forest**
   - Implementation: `random_forest_model.py`
   - Features: Lag indicators and rolling statistics
   - Good performance with non-linear patterns

4. **Time Series Decomposition**
   - Implementation: `decomposition.py`
   - Components: Trend, Seasonal, Residual
   - Used for understanding underlying patterns

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/dengue-ml-forecasting.git
cd dengue-ml-forecasting
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation
Place your dengue fever case data in `data/dataset_dengue.csv` with columns:
- time: Date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- n: Number of cases

### Running Models

1. Neural Network (NNAR):
```bash
python models/ann_model.py
```

2. ARIMA:
```bash
python models/arima_model.py
```

3. Random Forest:
```bash
python models/random_forest_model.py
```

4. Decomposition Analysis:
```bash
python models/decomposition.py
```

## Results

The models produce various visualizations and metrics:

- Training/validation loss curves
- Actual vs predicted plots
- Residual analysis plots
- Feature importance plots (Random Forest)
- Seasonal decomposition plots
- Error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAPE)
